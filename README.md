# MovieWebsite

## Description
This is a web application that is an extension of the other web application we have done for an assignment in uni.
I will be putting my own twist on it. I will also try to implement a RESTFUL api to run alongside it. This application
will make use of libraries like Flask, Jinja and WTForms. The main goal for this application will be to save lists of 
movies that you have watched and lists of movies that you plan to watch. You cannot actually watch movies on 
the site.
